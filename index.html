          <p>
            As a full-stack developer with a comprehensive grasp of front-end and back-end technologies, 
            I craft seamless user experiences backed by robust server-side logic. My toolbox includes React for dynamic interfaces, 
            Python for powerful scripting, Django as a high-level Python web framework, along with a solid foundation in JavaScript and CSS 
            for responsive design. My focus is on writing clean, efficient code to build scalable, maintainable web applications.
